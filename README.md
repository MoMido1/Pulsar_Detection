# Pulsar detection problem
This is a project that handels the analyzation and the detection of a Pulsar based on unbalanced data given to us which consist of different features. as we analyze these features and using Machine learning algorithems we will be able to recomend a classifier which for this problem performs the best in classification problem.

## Project
* [Report.pdf](Report.pdf) is the paper of the project that contains motivations to choices made during the analysis and explainations of remarkable results.
* [main.py](main.py) is the file from which you can obtain every plot and value shown in the paper.
* [library](library) is a folder containing a collection of Machine Learning algorithms.

## Main Addressed Specifications in [main.py](main.py)
* Features Analysis
* Z- Normalization of the Features
* Application of PCA
* Performing Algorithms
* Score calibration of the training set
* Calibration of the testing results

## Note
We haven't used any Machine Learning Algorithms as we approch this problem as the whole goal is to analyse the optimization of our ML Algorithms emplimentation
